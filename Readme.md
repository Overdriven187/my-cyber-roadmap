# My Cybersecurity Roadmap


## Introduction
Hi I am Overdriven187, A student from germany and I am on a journey to become a cybersecurity professional (pentester/ethical hacker). This repo is the collection of work i have done and also work that is coming up in the future to help me on my journey. Also this acts as a way for me to document my learning process in hope for helping other beginners or for possible employers :)

## Roadmap
This roadmap is inspired by many different sources but mainly from the following:
[Programming with Mosh](https://youtu.be/v7BNtpw53AA?si=gMy5552aKUttOG4C)  
[NetworkChuck](https://youtu.be/5xWnmUEi1Qw?si=jfL4NkpOTNx3UTHF)  
Deep research using Chatgpt/gemini and own research.

## Current state
Currently im learning:

- [C-Lang](/learning-C/) ->  
        Pretty sure most start with python but CLang is essential for me to understand how things work at a lower level and to help me with possible future exploit development. I already have a good understanding of C++ and python thanks to my [Robotics Project](https://github.com/Overdriven187/GSG_SmartiecarV2) aswell as some time skidding ;>

- [Network Fundamentals](/Network%20Fundamentals/)->  
        To even consider CyberSec you Have to learn the fundamentals. save to say everyone says to start with learning the fundamentals of networking. So Professor Messer's youtube playlist will be my go to for this.  

as of now this is how everything looks like. still a mess and a long way to go. but Rome wasnt built in a day :)
## Future Plans
Future plans include but are not limited to:
- Learning CLang in the sense of what is needed for CyberSec
- Completing certifications such as CompTIA A+ Network+ and Security+
maybe also CCNA
- Completing Python for Scripting and Automation 
- Learning Linux inside out  
...
and so on and so forth.
