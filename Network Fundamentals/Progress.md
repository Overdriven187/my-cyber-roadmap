# Start
i began with the lessons from professor messer today and was able to complete 5 lessons.
I am finishing first all the fundamentals of IT and going to complete my core 1/2 exams on the a+ exam first. 
all of my files for now are uploaded inside the [Comptia a+](/Network%20Fundamentals/CompTIA%20A+/) as a pdf.  
i will keep uploading and updating my entire progress as much as i possibly can to make sure i have a detailled roadmap at the end.
